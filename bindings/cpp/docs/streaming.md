# Streaming Adapter

Process large datasets in chunks with configurable overlap.

## When to Use

- Dataset >100,000 points
- Memory-constrained environments
- Batch processing pipelines

## Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chunk_size` | 5000 | Points per chunk |
| `overlap` | 500 | Overlap between chunks |
| `merge_strategy` | `"weighted_average"` | How to merge overlaps |

## Merge Strategies

| Strategy | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `"average"` | Average overlapping values |
| `"weighted_average"` | Distance-weighted blend |
| `"take_first"` | Keep left chunk values |
| `"take_last"` | Keep right chunk values |

## Example

```cpp
#include <fastlowess.hpp>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    const int n = 100;
    std::vector<double> x(n), y(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        x[i] = i * 2 * M_PI / (n - 1);
        y[i] = std::sin(x[i]) + 0.1;
    }


    fastlowess::StreamingOptions opts;
    opts.fraction = 0.3;
    opts.iterations = 2;
    opts.chunk_size = 5000;
    opts.overlap = 500;

    fastlowess::StreamingLowess stream(opts);
    (void)stream.process_chunk(x, y);
    auto result = stream.finalize().value();

    std::cout << "Smoothed " << result.y_vector().size() << " points\n";
    return 0;
}
```

```output
Smoothed 100 points
```

!!! warning "Always call finalize()"
    In Rust, always call `processor.finalize()` after processing all chunks to retrieve buffered overlap data.
