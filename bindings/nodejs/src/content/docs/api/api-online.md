## Class

### `OnlineLowess`

The `OnlineLowess` class updates the model incrementally with new data points.

**Constructor:**

```javascript
const { OnlineLowess } = require('fastlowess');

const online = new OnlineLowess({ fraction: 0.5 }, { window_capacity: 50, min_points: 3 });
// Feed enough points to pass min_points threshold
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    const result = online.add_point(i, Math.sin(i * 0.5));
    if (result !== null) console.log("Online smoothed at x=" + i + ":", result.y.toFixed(4));
}
```

```output
Online smoothed at x=2: 0.8415
Online smoothed at x=3: 0.9975
```

- `options`: An object containing `OnlineSmoothOptions` fields (a subset of the Batch `LowessOptions` fields — see below).
- `onlineOptions`: An object containing `OnlineOptions` fields.

#### `add_point(x, y)`

Adds a single point to the sliding window and returns the smoothed value for that point, or `null` while the window is still filling up (fewer than `min_points` seen so far). Once the window reaches `window_capacity`, each new point evicts the oldest one, so memory stays bounded regardless of how much history has passed through. `update_mode` controls how much work each call does: `"incremental"` re-fits only the newest point, while `"full"` re-smooths the entire window for a more accurate but slower result.

```javascript
const { OnlineLowess } = require('fastlowess');

const n = 100;
const x = Float64Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) => i * 2 * Math.PI / (n - 1));
const y = Float64Array.from(x, xi => Math.sin(xi) + 0.1);

const online = new OnlineLowess({ fraction: 0.5 }, { window_capacity: 50, min_points: 3 });

// Returns null until min_points (3) are reached
online.add_point(x[0], y[0]);  // null
online.add_point(x[1], y[1]);  // null

// Returns OnlineOutput once enough points are available
const result = online.add_point(x[2], y[2]);
console.log("Smoothed y:", result.y);
```

```output
Smoothed y: 0.22659245357374927
```

- Adds a single point to the sliding window and returns an `OnlineOutput` once enough points are available, or `null` while the window is still filling.

Confidence/prediction intervals, standard errors, cross-validation, GPU `backend`, `custom_weights`, `return_sorted`, `return_diagnostics`, `return_residuals`, and `parallel` are Batch-only (or Batch/Streaming-only) and not available here; see [fastLowess](api.md) for those.

## Options

### fraction

`fraction` is the most important parameter: it controls the size of the local neighbourhood used at each point.

| Range | Effect | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.1-0.3 | Fine detail | Rapidly changing signals |
| 0.3-0.5 | Balanced | General purpose |
| 0.5-0.7 | Heavy smoothing | Noisy data |
| 0.7-1.0 | Very smooth | Trend extraction |

### iterations

`iterations` controls robustness to outliers, at the cost of speed.

| Value | Effect | Performance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | No robustness | Fastest |
| 1-3 | Moderate | Recommended |
| 4-6 | Strong | Contaminated data |
| 7+ | Very strong | Heavy outliers |

### delta

Points within `delta` of each other on the x-axis share the same local fit instead of each computing its own regression — an interpolation shortcut that trades a small amount of accuracy for a large speedup on dense, evenly-spaced data. `NaN` (default) auto-sets it to `0` in Online mode, i.e. interpolation is disabled and every point is fit exactly.

### weight_function

*See: [Weight Functions](../weighting/kernels.md)*

- `"tricube"` (default)
- `"epanechnikov"`
- `"gaussian"`
- `"uniform"` (alias: `"boxcar"`)
- `"biweight"` (alias: `"bisquare"`)
- `"triangle"` (alias: `"triangular"`)
- `"cosine"`

### robustness_method

*See: [Robustness](../weighting/robustness.md)*

- `"bisquare"` (default; alias: `"biweight"`)
- `"huber"`
- `"talwar"`

### scaling_method

*See: [Scaling Methods](../weighting/scaling.md)*

- `"mad"` (default; alias: `"median_absolute_deviation"`)
- `"mar"` (alias: `"median_absolute_residual"`)
- `"mean"` (alias: `"mean_absolute_residual"`)

### boundary_policy

*See: [Boundary Handling](../advanced/boundary.md)*

- `"extend"` (default; alias: `"pad"`)
- `"reflect"` (alias: `"mirror"`)
- `"zero"`
- `"noboundary"` (alias: `"none"`)

### zero_weight_fallback

Behavior when all neighborhood weights are zero:

| Option | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `"use_local_mean"` (default; aliases: `"local_mean"`, `"mean"`) | Use the mean of the neighborhood |
| `"return_original"` (alias: `"original"`) | Return the original y value |
| `"return_none"` (alias: `"none"`) | Return `NaN` |

### auto_converge

*See: [Robustness](../weighting/robustness.md#auto-convergence)*

Convergence tolerance for early stopping of robustness iterations. `null` (default) disables early stopping.

### window_capacity

Maximum number of most recent points kept in the sliding window; older points are discarded as new ones arrive. Each `add_point()` call costs O(`window_capacity`) rather than growing with total history.

### min_points

Minimum number of points required before smoothing starts. `add_point()` returns `null` until the window reaches this size.

### update_mode

*See: [Execution Modes](../guide/adapter-choice.md)*

| Mode | Alias | Behavior | Speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `"incremental"` (default) | `"single"` | Update only affected fits | Faster |
| `"full"` | `"resmooth"` | Recompute entire window | More accurate |

## Result Structure

### `OnlineOutput`

Returned by `add_point()` once the window has enough points (`null` until then).

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `y` | `number` | Smoothed value for the latest point |
| `standard_error` | `number \| null` | Always `null` — standard errors require `return_se`/confidence intervals, which are Batch-only |
| `residual` | `number \| null` | Residual y − smoothed; always present (there is no `return_residuals` option for Online) |
| `robustness_weight` | `number \| null` | Robustness weight, if `return_robustness_weights` was set |
| `iterations_used` | `number \| null` | Robustness iterations performed |

There is no `Diagnostics` object or `return_diagnostics` option for `OnlineLowess`: `OnlineOutput` carries no diagnostics field, since diagnostics like RMSE/R² need more than one point's worth of history to be meaningful.
