# fastlowess (Node.js) 4.0.0

## Added

* Added an "Ideas for Contribution" section to `CONTRIBUTING.md`, listing concrete Batch/Streaming/Online adapter feature gaps (out-of-sample prediction, exposing local slope/derivative, adaptive fraction selection, STL-style decomposition, bootstrap intervals, concurrent chunk processing, checkpointable streaming state, populating `OnlineOutput.standard_error`, time-based window eviction, configurable warm-up) to invite contributions.
* `dev/bump_version.py` now also updates the example crate version in `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s "Individual crate Cargo.toml" snippet.
* Every GPU installer (Python, Node.js, R, Julia, C++, Java, Go) now accepts a local path to an already-built GPU artifact, installing from it directly instead of downloading from a GitHub Release — useful for testing the installer itself or installing an unreleased build. `ci-*.yml`'s `gpu` jobs now build the `gpu` feature locally and exercise this path end-to-end instead of depending on a matching published release existing.
* `release-gpu.yml` now uploads every GPU artifact (across all languages and all versions) to a single perpetual `gpu-builds` release instead of the release page for the version just published, so version release pages stay uncluttered; each asset's filename embeds its source version instead. Every installer's download URL updated to match.
* Added a `return_sorted` option to `Lowess`'s `SmoothOptions`.
* Added a `missing` option to `SmoothOptions`, `StreamingSmoothOptions`, and `OnlineSmoothOptions`.
* Expanded `release-gpu.yml`'s Node.js GPU binary builds from 4 platforms to all 9 the regular npm release covers (added `linux-x64-musl`, `linux-arm64-gnu`, `linux-arm64-musl`, `linux-arm-gnueabihf`, `win32-arm64-msvc`); `installGpu()` now detects all of them too.

## Changed

* Go doc-snippet verification now batch-builds every snippet in one `go build ./...` under a persistent module instead of one `go run` per snippet, then runs the binaries concurrently; `verify_snippets.py`'s `BATCH_RUNNERS` dispatch (previously Rust-only) now covers `go` too.
* C++ doc-snippet verification now resolves the compiler/library/MSVC setup once, then compiles+links+runs every snippet concurrently instead of one at a time. Fixed an MSVC race from concurrent `cl.exe` invocations colliding on a shared `snippet.obj` by giving each snippet its own `/Fo` output and `cwd`.
* Improved API docs for all bindings and crates significantly.
* Fixed several bindings' docs (Node.js, WASM, Go, Java, R) showing a flat `500` default for `overlap` instead of the actual dynamic `chunk_size / 10` (clamped to `[1, chunk_size - 10]`).
* Renamed Python's `docs/guide/adapters.md` and `docs/use-case/{genomics,real-time,time-series}.md` to match every other binding/crate's filenames (`adapter-choice.md`, `use-case-*.md`).
* Split `SmoothOptions` into `SmoothOptions` (Batch), `StreamingSmoothOptions`, and `OnlineSmoothOptions`. Passing Batch-only fields to `StreamingLowess`/`OnlineLowess` is now a TypeScript compile-time error instead of a silent no-op. Breaking change; `Lowess` is unaffected.

## Fixed

* Fixed `CONTRIBUTING.md` stating a stale Go prerequisite (`1.21+`, actually `1.23+` per `go.mod`/CI), an inaccurate `air` auto-install target (claimed `make r`, actually `make r-dev`), and a stale example crate version (`2.0.0`) in the Workspace Structure section.
* Fixed `OnlineOptions` doc comments stating `min_points` defaults to `3` (actually `2`) and `update_mode` defaults to `"full"` (actually `"incremental"`).
* Fixed `npm run build`/`build:debug` emitting only the generic `fastlowess.node`, which the loader in `index.js` never checks; added the missing `--platform` flag.
* Fixed `installGpu()` being non-functional: it lived inside the auto-generated `index.js`, which `napi build` fully rewrites, silently discarding it. Moved it to `gpu-installer.js`, re-attached via a new `postbuild` step. Also fixed it downloading to the wrong filename (the loader never checked it) and an `EBUSY` error on Windows from locking the file it was trying to overwrite.

# fastlowess (Node.js) 3.2.1

## Added

* Added `dev/bump_version.py --version X.Y.Z` to bump every crate/binding's version files, `CITATION.cff`, and the Spack recipe in one pass (supports `--dry-run`); now also bumps `Project.toml`'s `fastlowess_jll` compat floor (safe pre-publish since `make julia-dev`/CI relax it to an OR-list at test-time).
* Added an optional `commit` input to every release workflow's `workflow_dispatch` trigger, to pin the built commit for manual runs.
* Added an `aarch64-pc-windows-gnullvm` linker entry to the root `.cargo/config.toml`, matching the existing `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` one; makes local arm64 Windows builds work without a manual env var.
* Added `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` and `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` prebuilt targets with matching optional npm subpackages.

## Changed

* Added four new pins to `dev/check_pinned_versions.py`: R's `rextendr`/`roxygen2` versions and the vendored KaTeX CDN version in both Rust crates.
* Changed `check-versions.yml` to open/update a GitHub issue instead of failing CI when a pin goes stale or unreachable.
* Updated `@astrojs/starlight` to v0.42, `@napi-rs/cli` to v3.9, and `astro` to v7.3.

## Fixed

* Fixed a handful of `R²`/`O(n²)` Unicode superscripts the earlier ASCII-fication pass missed (added/edited after it ran) — R tests and several `lowess` crate doc-comments — replaced with `R2`/`O(n^2)`.
* Fixed `release-conda.yml`'s `sed` patterns for the feedstock's new rattler-build `recipe/recipe.yaml` format, removing now-dead R-package-name-fix/Python-dependency-injection/`build_r.sh` steps.
* Fixed `dev/check_links.py` false-flagging valid R vignette links to a sibling's rendered `.html` (R CMD build renders `.Rmd`→`.html`) as broken.
* Fixed every binding's/crate's docs and doc-comments describing `LowessResult.x` (and equivalents) as "Sorted x values"; it's actually returned in the same order as the input `x` (the algorithm sorts internally, then un-sorts every output field back to the original order). Also strengthened Python's `test_unsorted_input` to assert this instead of only checking output length.
* Fixed `.github/dependabot.yml`'s `cargo` entry for `/bindings/r/src`, which could never succeed: its `fastLowess = { path = "vendor/fastLowess" }` path dependency is only committed as `vendor.tar.xz`, never as loose files Dependabot can read. Removed the entry and added `extendr-api`'s version to `dev/check_pinned_versions.py` instead, which also uncovered and fixed a version-comparison bug there: comparing raw tuples treated a shorthand pin like `"0.9"` as older than `"0.9.0"` due to tuple-length tiebreaking; now padded to equal length first.

# fastlowess (Node.js) 3.2.0

## Added

* Added `dev/add-readme-to-docs.py`, which auto-detects the Hugo (Go, Java) vs Starlight (Node.js, WASM) docs-site flavor and embeds `README.md` accordingly; wired into the corresponding Makefiles and `package.json` scripts.
* Added `.github/dependabot.yml`, covering every dependency ecosystem in the repo (`github-actions`, `cargo`, `npm`, `pip`, `maven`, `gomod`). Each directory is grouped so all its updates, including majors, land in a single weekly PR.
* Added `dev/check_pinned_versions.py` and a weekly `.github/workflows/check-versions.yml`, which check hardcoded tool/library version pins that Dependabot can't see (Corrosion's CMake `FetchContent` tag, the vendored doxygen-awesome-css theme, the Checkstyle jar, golangci-lint, and Hugo) against their latest GitHub release and fail CI if any are outdated. Read-only: it never opens PRs or edits files itself.
* Added a `VERSION` export (`bindings/nodejs/index.js`), sourced from `package.json`, so consumers can query the Node.js binding's own version without reaching into `require('fastlowess/package.json')` directly.

## Changed

* Modified `verify_snippets.py` to verify snippets and also add the output of the snippets to the markdown file.
* Added a `large` benchmark category (n = 50000) to `benchmarks/rfastlowess.R` and `benchmarks/stats_lowess.R`, since every existing category ran in well under 100ms. Covers 4 scenarios (`large_delta_0`, `large_delta_0.1`, `large_high_iter`, `large_high_fraction`) stressing `delta`, iteration count, and fraction. `benchmarks/compare.py`'s plot grid grew from 5x2 to 7x2 to fit them.
* Added `.gitattributes`, normalizing all text files to LF line endings (`* text=auto eol=lf`) and marking binary formats (images, archives, compiled libraries, `.rds`/`.RData`, etc.) so Git never treats them as text.
* Consolidated every crate/binding README: merged the "Installation" and "Documentation" sections, replaced GitHub-only alert syntax with plain blockquotes, removed the redundant "API Reference" and "Changelog" sections (each now has its own docs-site page), shortened the "GPU Backend" blurb, and added a "Read more" link to the Concepts page. The top-level repository README is unchanged, since it's only ever viewed on GitHub.
* Renamed the batch adapter's "When to Use" heading to "When to Use Batch Adapter" across every binding/crate's API docs.
* Vendored the [doxygen-awesome-css](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css) theme (v2.4.2) for a modern, sidebar-only cpp Doxygen site with automatic dark mode.
* Added `dev/update_changelogs.py`, which regenerates a per-binding/crate `NEWS.md`/`news.md` from the root `CHANGELOG.md`. Wired into every docs site's navigation, the Rust crates' rustdoc module tree, and every `Makefile` `dev` target.
* Replaced `kernels.md`'s "Choosing a Kernel" mermaid flowchart (every binding/crate) with an equivalent decision table, since Doxygen and rustdoc don't render mermaid and the deeply-nested diamond chain was hard to read even where it did render.
* Replaced `adapter-choice.md`/`adapters.md`'s "Overview" flowchart (mermaid in most bindings/crates, ASCII art in the C++ docs) with an equivalent decision table, unifying on a single rendering-agnostic format across every binding/crate.
* Moved the duplicated "GPU Acceleration" section out of `api.md` (C++, Node.js, Python, `fastLowess`) into each one's dedicated `gpu-backend.md` guide, which also gained "Hardware Requirements"/"Performance Considerations"; `api.md` now just links to it. Removed the section entirely from the `lowess` crate, which has no `gpu` feature.
* Consolidated `parameters.md`/the auto-generated parameter reference across every binding and crate: merged its unique content (fraction/iterations guidance, `delta` defaults, `zero_weight_fallback` behavior) into each `api.md`'s option tables, then removed `parameters.md` and its nav entries/rustdoc module — the option lists and examples it duplicated already live on their own pages.
* Standardized docs across all bindings and crates.
* Replaced the Unicode superscript `²` character with plain ASCII throughout every doc page and doc-comment (`R²` → `R2`; `(y_true - y_pred)²`/`O(window²)` → `^2`), including the `wasm` binding's JSDoc comments, the Julia docstrings in `FastLOWESS.jl`, and the `fastLowess`/`lowess` crates' rustdoc examples. Also changed the `lowess` crate's `Diagnostics` `Display` impl to print `R2` instead of `R²` so the `fastLowess` doc example showing its captured output stays accurate.
* Harmonized the docs-site directory structure across every binding/crate to mirror Go's layout (`introduction/`, `guide/`, `weighting/`, `advanced/`, `use-case/`, `api/`, each grouped under a hub page): Node.js/WASM (Starlight `sidebar`), Python (Sphinx toctree, also removed the dead `mkdocs.yml`), Julia (`Documenter.jl` `pages=[...]`, switched to recursive `walkdir`), and `fastLowess`/`lowess` (nested `#[cfg(doc)]` modules). C++'s Doxygen pages were physically moved to match (`RECURSIVE: YES`), with two hub pages renamed for parity. Java already matched this layout and now carries it into its new Antora site. R's `vignettes/` stays flat (CRAN/pkgdown requirement).
* Updated `napi` to v3.12.
* Updated `napi-derive` to v3.6.
* Updated `napi-build` to v2.4.
* Updated `typedoc-plugin-markdown` to v4.13.
* `make nodejs-dev` now runs `npm update` after `npm install`, so dependencies are kept current.

## Fixed

* Fixed `docs.yml` triggering GitHub's "pages build and deployment" once per docs job; per-language jobs now upload artifacts, and a single final `deploy` job pushes to `gh-pages` once per run.
* Fixed `docs.yml`'s reliance on GitHub's legacy branch-based Pages deployment, which auto-triggered an unpinned "pages build and deployment" job on every `gh-pages` push. The former `deploy` job is now `build` (still pushes `_site` to `gh-pages` as a cache); publishing now goes through `actions/upload-pages-artifact` and a new `deploy` job using `actions/deploy-pages`. Requires the repo's Pages source set to "GitHub Actions".
* Fixed every benchmark category in `benchmarks/rfastlowess.R` failing with `attempt to apply non-function`: it called the R6-style `model$fit(x, y)`, but `fit` is an S3 generic (`fit(model, x, y)`), not a field on the `Lowess` object. Also fixed `benchmarks/stats_lowess.R` resolving its `output/` directory relative to the current working directory instead of the script's own location (unlike `rfastlowess.R`, which already did this correctly), so results could land outside `benchmarks/output/` depending on how the script was invoked.
* Fixed the "Handling Outliers" quickstart example (every binding, `lowess`/`fastLowess`) printing nothing: with only 6 points and `fraction = 0.5`, tricube weighting left just 2 effectively-weighted points, which a degree-1 fit reproduces exactly (zero residual). Bumped to `fraction = 0.7`, which correctly downweights the injected outlier.
* Fixed the R `OnlineLowess()` roxygen example printing one line per point (48 lines for a 50-point loop); it now collects the smoothed values and prints only `head(smoothed, 5)`.
* Fixed the R `add_point()` roxygen example always printing `NULL`, since a single call never reaches the default `min_points = 3`; it now uses `min_points = 2L` and shows the second (non-`NULL`) call's result.
* Fixed the R `robustness.Rmd` "Detecting Outliers" example printing 22 lines at the `weight < 0.5` threshold, most of them incidental noise rather than the 3 deliberately injected outliers; tightened to `weight < 0.05`, which isolates the points effectively excluded by the fit.
* Fixed the R `merge.Rmd` "Choosing Chunk Size and Overlap" example constructing a `StreamingLowess` model but never printing anything; it now prints the computed overlap size and its percentage of `chunk_size`.
* Fixed the R `use-case-genomics.Rmd` ChIP-seq example never calling `fit()`, so `result` referenced a stale variable from an earlier chunk and the smoothed line either failed to plot or didn't align with the current example's x-range; added the missing `result <- fit(model, positions, signal_noisy)` call.
* Fixed the R `use-case-real-time.Rmd` "Update Modes" example constructing a `"full"`-mode `OnlineLowess` model but never feeding it data or plotting a result; it now runs the same accumulate-and-plot pattern as the preceding example.
* Fixed the "Detecting Outliers" example's `robustness.md` page (C++, Node.js, WASM, and the `lowess`/`fastLowess` crates) printing an unbounded number of "is likely an outlier" lines; capped output at 5 lines, matching the already-capped Julia and Python versions and the R vignette fix above.
* Fixed the Julia `intervals.md` "Confidence Intervals" and "Standard Errors" examples each looping over all 100 points instead of a short sample; switched to `result.y[1:5]`/`result.confidence_lower[1:5]`/`result.standard_errors[1:5]`-style slicing, matching the already-concise Python version.
* Fixed the docs homepage never showing the README content ("Get Started" jumped straight to Installation): a new `dev/add-readme-to-docs.js` script embeds `README.md` below the hero (stripping its redundant `# LOWESS Project` H1, since the hero already shows the title), wired into `npm run docs` and `make nodejs-dev`.
* Fixed the docs build always emitting a `[@astrojs/sitemap] The Sitemap integration requires the site astro.config option` warning when the `SITE` environment variable isn't set (e.g. local builds); `astro.config.mjs` now falls back to the production GitHub Pages URL.
* Fixed every link on the "API Reference" page 404ing: TypeDoc preserves original casing (e.g. `classes/Lowess.md`) but Starlight lowercases route slugs and never strips `.md`. A new `dev/lowercase-typedoc-refs.js` script lowercases generated file names and rewrites internal links after `typedoc` runs, wired into `npm run docs`.
* Fixed `custom-weights.md`'s "Zero-weight windows" `:::caution` admonition closing one line early, leaving its second sentence rendered as plain, oddly-indented text below the callout instead of inside it.

# fastlowess (Node.js) 3.1.0

## Added

* Added a GitHub Pages landing page at the repository root, built from `README.md` via pandoc and deployed by `docs.yml`.
* Added a GitHub workflow for running validation scripts.
* Added `npm run lint` to the `Lint` step in `ci-nodejs.yml`, so JavaScript source and test files are linted via `oxlint` on every CI run.

## Changed

* Split the monolithic `.github/workflows/ci.yml` into seven per-language workflow files: `ci-rust.yml`, `ci-python.yml`, `ci-julia.yml`, `ci-nodejs.yml`, `ci-wasm.yml`, `ci-cpp.yml`, and `ci-r.yml`. Each file carries the relevant `ci` (multi-OS matrix), `asan`, and `gpu` jobs for its language.
* Each crate/binding sub-Makefile now runs `dev/verify_snippets.py --lang <lang>` for its own language as the final step of `make default`. The root `docs-test` target remains as a convenience to run all languages at once.
* Split `dev/verify_snippets.py` into a lean orchestrator and a `dev/runners/` package. Each language has its own module (`python.py`, `julia.py`, `nodejs.py`, `r.py`, `wasm.py`, `rust.py`, `cpp.py`) containing its `run_<lang>()` function and a `skip_reason()` predicate. Shared types (`Snippet`, `RunResult`) and utilities live in `runners/base.py`; the registry (`RUNNERS`, `SKIP_CHECKS`) is exported from `runners/__init__.py`.
* Moved CHANGELOG and CONTRIBUTING guides to project root.
* Updated README files to be binding/crate specific instead of one generic README for all bindings/crates.
* Moved Node.js documentation from ReadTheDocs to GitHub Pages, served by Starlight at <https://thisisamirv.github.io/lowess-project/nodejs/>. The ReadTheDocs site no longer includes Node.js-specific content. `dev/add-nodejs-outputs.js` runs as part of `make nodejs-dev`, executing each JavaScript code block in the docs and injecting its output back into the Markdown source.
* `make nodejs` (`default:`) now builds the native addon and links it globally via `npm link`. The full dev workflow moves to `make nodejs-dev`.
* Updated `oxlint` dependency to 1.80.

## Fixed

* Fixed `.cargo/config.toml` hardcoding absolute `c:/rtools45/...` paths for the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` linker and ar tool. Replaced with bare tool names resolved via `PATH`, matching the existing fix in `bindings/r/src/cargo-config.toml`.

# fastlowess (Node.js) 3.0.0

## Added

* Exposed a `backend` option (`"cpu"` default, `"gpu"`) on `Lowess`, gated behind an opt-in `gpu` Cargo feature not enabled in published npm binaries. Run `await fastlowess.installGpu()` to download a prebuilt GPU addon (requires restarting Node.js), or build locally with `napi build --features gpu`.

## Changed

* Removed `dev/isolate_cargo.py`, `dev/check_root_cargo.py`, `dev/fix_doc_snippets.py`, and `check_js_licenses.js` — workspace isolation, doc-snippet transformation, and license checks are no longer needed.
* Split the monolithic root `Makefile` into per-crate/binding sub-Makefiles (e.g. `crates/lowess/Makefile`, `bindings/r/Makefile`), each invokable directly via `make -f path/Makefile`. The root `Makefile` now only aggregates (`docs`, `check-msrv`, `all*`).
* Moved Rust and binding tests into their respective crate/binding directories (e.g. `tests/lowess/` → `crates/lowess/tests/lowess/`, `tests/cpp/` → `bindings/cpp/tests/`). Removed the standalone `tests/` workspace packages and `bindings/r/demo/`.
* Renamed `OnlineOutput`'s `smoothed` and `std_error` fields to `y` and `standard_error`. This is a **breaking change**.
* Updated `@napi-rs/cli` to v3.8 and `oxlint` to v1.79.

# fastlowess (Node.js) 2.0.0

## Added

* Added `OnlineOutput` object to the Node.js binding. `OnlineLowess.add_point()` now returns `OnlineOutput | null` instead of `number | null`, exposing `smoothed`, `std_error`, `residual`, `robustness_weight`, and `iterations_used`.
* Added `return_se` and `cv_seed` fields to `SmoothOptions`.
* Added `customWeights` as an optional per-call argument to `fit(x, y, customWeights?)` and `fit_async(x, y, customWeights?)`. Accepts a `Float64Array` of non-negative per-observation weights. Includes pre-flight length-mismatch and non-negative validation. Batch only.
* Added JavaScript-layer option key validation: unknown keys in `SmoothOptions`, `StreamingOptions`, or `OnlineOptions` now throw a `TypeError` listing all valid keys, via wrapper classes around the native NAPI exports.

## Changed

* Renamed all public API method and option names from camelCase to snake_case across every binding and all documentation. This is a **breaking change** for all consumers of the C++, Node.js, and WASM APIs.
* Converted all documentation tables to compact single-space format.
* Updated `.clang-tidy` to configure `lower_case` as the required naming convention for functions and member functions, matching the new snake_case public API.
* Moved `BENCHMARKS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` from the repository root into `docs/` and added them to the documentation site navigation.
* Added a `[patch.crates-io]` section to the root `Cargo.toml` so all workspace bindings resolve `fastLowess` and `lowess` to the local workspace crates during development, replacing the previously-used registry (crates.io) versions.
* Eliminated all local `parse_*` functions that each binding previously duplicated independently. Option parsing and builder application now delegates to `fastLowess::binding_support`, ensuring consistent aliases, validation messages, and behaviour across every language frontend.
* Replaced direct use of `KFold` / `LOOCV` constructor types in the cross-validation path with `binding_support::apply_cross_validation`.
* Split the Julia release CI workflow into two separate workflows: `release-julia-jll.yml` (triggered on release, opens the Yggdrasil PR) and `release-julia-register.yml` (manual dispatch, triggers JuliaRegistrator once the JLL PR is merged).
* Major documentation improvements.
* Renamed all `Diagnostics`, `SmoothOptions`, `StreamingOptions`, and `OnlineOptions` interface fields to snake_case (`r_squared`, `effective_df`, `residual_sd`, `chunk_size`, `merge_strategy`, `window_capacity`, `min_points`, `update_mode`, and all smoothing option fields).
* Renamed binding methods to snake_case: `fit_async`, `process_chunk`, `add_points`.
* Renamed `LowessResultObj` getters to snake_case: `standard_errors`, `confidence_lower`, `confidence_upper`, `prediction_lower`, `prediction_upper`, `robustness_weights`, `cv_scores`, `fraction_used`, `iterations_used`.
* Updated `index.d.ts` to reflect all renamed fields and methods.
* Replaced `add_points(x: Float64Array, y: Float64Array): LowessResultObj` on `OnlineLowess` with `add_point(x: number, y: number): OnlineOutput | null`. The method now processes a single point and returns an `OnlineOutput` object, or `null` if not enough points have been accumulated yet. This is a **breaking change**.
* Changed default `OnlineOptions.window_capacity` from 100 to 1000 and `OnlineOptions.min_points` from 2 to 3, matching the defaults used by the loess binding.
* `OnlineLowess` now forwards all `SmoothOptions` fields to the underlying builder (previously only `fraction`, `iterations`, and `parallel` were forwarded; all other fields were hardcoded to `None`/`false`).
* Updated `napi-rs/cli` dependency to v3.7 and `oxlint` to v1.73.

# fastlowess (Node.js) 1.3.0

## Added

* Added prerequisites for different bindings and platforms to `CONTRIBUTING.md`
* Updated `docs/assets/diagrams/lowess_smoothing_concept.svg` to correctly illustrate LOWESS concepts (robustness iterations, bisquare re-weighting, outlier downweighting) instead of the generic LOESS algorithm it previously depicted.
* Modified `docs/requirements.txt` to update the versions of the documentation dependencies.
* Improved CI tests and coverage.
* Modified Makefile to be truely cross-platform.
* Added sanitizer check for all bindings and crates.
* Upgraded `oxlint` to 1.63.
* Upgraded `napi-rs/cli` to 3.6.

## Changed

* Updated MSRV to 1.89 to access the significant improvements made in `wide` since version 0.7.

## Fixed

* Fixed R ASAN tests failing to compile vignettes by passing `--no-build-vignettes` to `rcmdcheck`.
* Upgraded ASAN test environment to use modern `rocker/r-devel-san:latest` image and `RDscript` to resolve outdated `readelf` warnings.
* Fixed `Makefile` idempotency checks on Linux by providing a default `/tmp` fallback for the `TEMP` directory variable.
* Fixed accidental root `Cargo.toml` workspace isolation leaks by adding checked-in `pre-commit` and `pre-push` git hook guards that restore `Cargo.toml.bak` when present and fail loudly if required workspace members are still commented out.
* Added a repo-local `.cargo/config.toml` that sets `CC=clang-cl` for `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, fixing Criterion 0.8 benchmark builds on Windows when `cc-rs` would otherwise pick `clang.exe` and fail to link `alloca`.
* Fixed `make nodejs` on Windows when `/bin/bash` could not launch `npm` from `C:/Program Files/nodejs` by using `npm.cmd`/`npx.cmd` in the `Makefile`.
* Fixed deprecated JavaScript license-audit warnings by replacing the transient `npx license-checker` usage in the `Makefile` with a repo-local Node.js license summary script that still fails on GPL-family licenses.
* Fixed `.build()` errors incorrectly using `Status::GenericFailure`; they now return `Status::InvalidArg` since build failures originate from invalid configuration (accumulated parse errors), not from runtime execution.
* Linted the source code.
