## BiocCheck Results

### NOTES

* **No 'fnd' role found in Authors@R**: This work is not supported by any specific grant or funding agency.

### WARNINGS

* **No Bioconductor dependencies detected**: This package provides a fundamental statistical smoothing algorithm (LOWESS) implemented in Rust. It is designed to be a lightweight, high-performance primitive that can be used by other Bioconductor packages, rather than depending on specific Bioconductor data structures itself.
