# rfastlowess (development version)

## Changed

* Consolidated every crate/binding README: merged the "Installation" and "Documentation" sections, replaced GitHub-only alert syntax with plain blockquotes, removed the redundant "API Reference" and "Changelog" sections (each now has its own docs-site page), shortened the "GPU Backend" blurb, and added a "Read more" link to the Concepts page. The top-level repository README is unchanged, since it's only ever viewed on GitHub.
* Renamed the batch adapter's "When to Use" heading to "When to Use Batch Adapter" across every binding/crate's API docs.
* Vendored the [doxygen-awesome-css](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css) theme (v2.4.2) for a modern, sidebar-only cpp Doxygen site with automatic dark mode.
* Added `dev/update_changelogs.py`, which regenerates a per-binding/crate `NEWS.md`/`news.md` from the root `CHANGELOG.md`. Wired into every docs site's navigation, the Rust crates' rustdoc module tree, and every `Makefile` `dev` target.
* Moved the duplicated "GPU Acceleration" section (installation, usage, supported features, feature comparison) out of `api.md` in the C++, Node.js, and Python bindings and the `fastLowess` crate into each one's dedicated `gpu-backend.md` guide, which also gained the "Hardware Requirements" and "Performance Considerations" subsections previously only in `api.md`; `api.md` now links to `gpu-backend.md` with a short blurb instead. Removed the same section from the `lowess` crate's `api.md` entirely, since that crate has no `gpu` Cargo feature or GPU backend to document.
* Consolidated `parameters.md`/the auto-generated `@autodocs` parameter reference across every binding and crate (C++, Julia, Node.js, Python, WASM, `fastLowess`, `lowess`): merged its unique content (fraction/iterations choice guidance, `delta`'s per-adapter default, and an inline `zero_weight_fallback` behavior table) into each `api.md`'s builder/options tables (Julia: into the `Lowess`/`StreamingLowess`/`OnlineLowess` docstrings), and removed `parameters.md` itself along with its docs-site navigation entries, `doc::parameters` rustdoc module, and cross-references (now pointing at `api.md`) — the parameter tables, kernel/robustness/boundary/scaling/merge-strategy option lists, and interval/custom-weights code examples it duplicated already live on their own dedicated pages.
* Removed the `rfastlowess-package` pkgdown topic, which duplicated the adapter class list, and unexported the internal `Nullable()` helper.
* Fixed `_pkgdown.yml` describing the core interface as "R6 classes" when the package actually uses S3 classes.
* Merged `vignettes/parameters.Rmd`'s parameter reference (ranges, defaults, and fraction-choice guidance) into the `@param`/`@details` roxygen docs of `Lowess()`, `StreamingLowess()`, and `OnlineLowess()`, and removed the now-redundant vignette.
* Merged `vignettes/batch.Rmd`, `streaming.Rmd`, and `online.Rmd`'s unique content (When to Use guidance, merge strategy comparison) into the `@description`/`@details` roxygen docs of `Lowess()`, `StreamingLowess()`, and `OnlineLowess()`, and removed the now-redundant vignettes and their orphaned `gap_handling.svg`/`online_comparison.svg` diagrams.

## Fixed

* Fixed `docs.yml` triggering GitHub's "pages build and deployment" once per docs job; per-language jobs now upload artifacts, and a single final `deploy` job pushes to `gh-pages` once per run.

# rfastlowess 3.1.0

## Added

* Added a GitHub Pages landing page at the repository root, built from `README.md` via pandoc and deployed by `docs.yml`.
* Added a GitHub workflow for running validation scripts.
* Added `lenght` gaurds for extra arguments.

## Changed

* Split the monolithic `.github/workflows/ci.yml` into seven per-language workflow files: `ci-rust.yml`, `ci-python.yml`, `ci-julia.yml`, `ci-nodejs.yml`, `ci-wasm.yml`, `ci-cpp.yml`, and `ci-r.yml`. Each file carries the relevant `ci` (multi-OS matrix), `asan`, and `gpu` jobs for its language.
* Each crate/binding sub-Makefile now runs `dev/verify_snippets.py --lang <lang>` for its own language as the final step of `make default`. The root `docs-test` target remains as a convenience to run all languages at once.
* Split `dev/verify_snippets.py` into a lean orchestrator and a `dev/runners/` package. Each language has its own module (`python.py`, `julia.py`, `nodejs.py`, `r.py`, `wasm.py`, `rust.py`, `cpp.py`) containing its `run_<lang>()` function and a `skip_reason()` predicate. Shared types (`Snippet`, `RunResult`) and utilities live in `runners/base.py`; the registry (`RUNNERS`, `SKIP_CHECKS`) is exported from `runners/__init__.py`.
* Moved CHANGELOG and CONTRIBUTING guides to project root.
* Updated README files to be binding/crate specific instead of one generic README for all bindings/crates.
* Simplified `bindings/r/Makefile`: replaced `Cargo.toml.orig` save/restore vendoring with `src/vendor-update.sh`; made `[workspace]` permanent in `src/Cargo.toml`; removed Bioconductor dependencies, redundant `cargo fmt --check`, `NAMESPACE` indentation post-processing, and `pkgdown::build_site` from the dev workflow.
* Moved R documentation from ReadTheDocs to GitHub Pages, served by pkgdown at <https://thisisamirv.github.io/loess-project/r/>. The ReadTheDocs site no longer includes R-specific content.
* Changed R version dependency to 4.4.0 due to issues with installing Bioconducter packages on R < 4.4.0.
* Replaced the multi-step `install.packages` / `BiocManager::install` package installation logic in `bindings/r/Makefile` with a single [`pak`](https://pak.r-lib.org/)-based block. `pak` handles RSPM binary vs source selection automatically (including Linux), skips already-installed packages, and installs CRAN, Bioconductor (`bioc::` prefix), and R-universe packages in one call.
* `make r` (`default:`) now runs `R CMD INSTALL $(R_DIR)` directly; R's `configure` script handles Rust compilation from the committed `vendor.tar.xz`. The full dev workflow moves to `make r-dev`.

## Fixed

* Fixed `.cargo/config.toml` hardcoding absolute `c:/rtools45/...` paths for the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` linker and ar tool. Replaced with bare tool names resolved via `PATH`, matching the existing fix in `bindings/r/src/cargo-config.toml`.
* Fixed Windows arm64 (R-Universe) build: `ar x` without a member name correctly resolves long-name archive entries (>16 chars stored as `/<offset>`); named extraction silently fails for such entries. Used `objcopy --remove-section=.idata$4` on each extracted `.dll` stub to strip the invalid relocations that lld 19 rejects, then `ar r` to re-insert.
* Fixed `ld.lld` crashing or dropping symbols (`WakeByAddressSingle`, `WaitOnAddress`) on Windows arm64: `--whole-archive` pulls every crate's raw-dylib stub for a given DLL into the link, but different crates' stubs cover different, non-overlapping symbols of that DLL — `--allow-multiple-definition` works on x86_64 but crashes lld's arm64pe backend. Fixed by dropping `--whole-archive` on `gnullvm`; normal archive resolution applies and nothing is lost since `entrypoint.c` already references the extendr init symbol directly.
* Fixed CRAN Windows build (`error: linker not found`): `cargo-config.toml` hardcoded linker/ar as `c:/rtools45/...` absolute paths, which break when Rtools is installed on a different drive. Fixed by using bare tool names resolved via `PATH`.
* Fixed CRAN Windows build (`cannot find -lgcc_eh`): the Rtools gcc lib directory is not writable on CRAN's server, and config-file `rustflags` does not reach build-script linker invocations. `Makevars.win` creates an empty stub via `touch` in `$(TARGET_DIR)/libgcc_mock/` and passes `LIBRARY_PATH` inline on `cargo build`. The path is resolved to an absolute path via `$(pwd)` at shell execution time — a relative path silently fails because Cargo invokes GCC to link build scripts from its own temp directory, not from `src/`.
* Fixed `Lowess(fraction = 0.3, 4)` incorrectly succeeding: `reject_extra_positional_args()` counted unnamed arguments but did not check their position, so a single unnamed arg in any non-first slot passed validation. The check now rejects any unnamed argument that is not in position 1.

# rfastlowess 3.0.0

## Added

* Exposed a `backend` option (`"cpu"` default, `"gpu"`) on `Lowess`, gated behind an opt-in `gpu` Cargo feature not enabled in CRAN/Bioconductor releases. Run `install_gpu()` to download a prebuilt GPU library (requires restarting R), or build locally with `make -f bindings/r/Makefile WITH_GPU=1`.
* Introduced S3 generics `fit()`, `process_chunk()`, `finalize()`, and `add_point()`, replacing the previous list-closure API.
* `bindings/r/Makefile` now auto-installs [Air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/) if missing, before running `air format`.
* Added a `reject_extra_positional_args()` helper to reject extra unnamed arguments.

## Fixed

* Fixed incorrect URLs in R binding docs.

## Changed

* Removed `dev/isolate_cargo.py`, `dev/check_root_cargo.py`, `dev/fix_doc_snippets.py`, and `check_js_licenses.js` — workspace isolation, doc-snippet transformation, and license checks are no longer needed.
* Split the monolithic root `Makefile` into per-crate/binding sub-Makefiles (e.g. `crates/lowess/Makefile`, `bindings/r/Makefile`), each invokable directly via `make -f path/Makefile`. The root `Makefile` now only aggregates (`docs`, `check-msrv`, `all*`).
* Moved Rust and binding tests into their respective crate/binding directories (e.g. `tests/lowess/` → `crates/lowess/tests/lowess/`, `tests/cpp/` → `bindings/cpp/tests/`). Removed the standalone `tests/` workspace packages and `bindings/r/demo/`.
* Renamed the `smoothed` and `std_error` fields returned by `OnlineLowess`'s `add_point()` to `y` and `standard_error`. This is a **breaking change**.
* Replaced `dev/style_pkg.R` with [Air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/) for formatting.
* Removed `dev/fix_rd_style.R`, `dev/prepare_cargo.py`, `dev/patch_vendor_crates.py`, `dev/clean_checksums.py`, and `dev/prepare_cran.sh` — their logic is now inlined directly in `bindings/r/Makefile`, so the R build no longer requires any Python scripts.
* Added `...` to `Lowess()`, `StreamingLowess()`, and `OnlineLowess()` to force named arguments for optional parameters.
* Added `Depends: R (>= 4.6)` to `DESCRIPTION` and a matching CI matrix entry.
* Expanded roxygen2 `@param` docs and added a `See Also` section linking to <https://lowess.readthedocs.io/>.
* Expanded `rfastlowess-intro.Rmd` vignettes.

# rfastlowess 2.0.0

## Added

* Added `custom_weights` parameter to `fit(Lowess, )`. Accepts a numeric vector of non-negative per-observation weights. Batch only.

## Changed

* Renamed all public API method and option names from camelCase to snake_case across every binding and all documentation. This is a **breaking change** for all consumers of the C++, Node.js, and WASM APIs.
* Converted all documentation tables to compact single-space format.
* Updated `.clang-tidy` to configure `lower_case` as the required naming convention for functions and member functions, matching the new snake_case public API.
* Moved `BENCHMARKS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` from the repository root into `docs/` and added them to the documentation site navigation.
* Added a `[patch.crates-io]` section to the root `Cargo.toml` so all workspace bindings resolve `fastLowess` and `lowess` to the local workspace crates during development, replacing the previously-used registry (crates.io) versions.
* Eliminated all local `parse_*` functions that each binding previously duplicated independently. Option parsing and builder application now delegates to `fastLowess::binding_support`, ensuring consistent aliases, validation messages, and behaviour across every language frontend.
* Replaced direct use of `KFold` / `LOOCV` constructor types in the cross-validation path with `binding_support::apply_cross_validation`.
* Split the Julia release CI workflow into two separate workflows: `release-julia-jll.yml` (triggered on release, opens the Yggdrasil PR) and `release-julia-register.yml` (manual dispatch, triggers JuliaRegistrator once the JLL PR is merged).
* Major documentation improvements.
* Replaced `$add_points(x, y)` (vector inputs returning a list result) on `OnlineLowess` with `$add_point(x, y)` (scalar inputs returning `numeric` or `NULL`). The method now processes one point at a time and returns `NULL` until enough points have been accumulated. This is a **breaking change**.

# rfastlowess 1.3.0

## Added

* Added prerequisites for different bindings and platforms to `CONTRIBUTING.md`
* Updated `docs/assets/diagrams/lowess_smoothing_concept.svg` to correctly illustrate LOWESS concepts (robustness iterations, bisquare re-weighting, outlier downweighting) instead of the generic LOESS algorithm it previously depicted.
* Modified `docs/requirements.txt` to update the versions of the documentation dependencies.
* Improved CI tests and coverage.
* Modified Makefile to be truely cross-platform.
* Added sanitizer check for all bindings and crates.
* Upgraded `rextendr` scaffold to 0.5.0: bumped `Config/rextendr/version` in `DESCRIPTION` and updated `entrypoint.c` to register the extendr panic hook (`register_extendr_panic_hook()`), so Rust panics now surface as R errors instead of crashing the session.
* Added `dev/fix_rd_style.R` post-processing script to automatically normalize Rd file indentation (to 4 spaces) and wrap long lines (> 80 characters), ensuring compliance with CRAN/pkgcheck stylistic notes.
* Added `bindings/r/_pkgdown.yml` configuration and updated the `Makefile` to use `pkgdown::build_site()`, satisfying the `pkgcheck` requirement for a dedicated documentation website.
* Added automatic copying of shared tests from the project root into the R package within `dev/prepare_cran.sh`, ensuring `R CMD build` is self-contained.
* Added direct `extendr` wrapper coverage tests plus extra validation-path tests in the R package, lifting `covr::package_coverage()` to 100% and clearing the package-level `pkgcheck`/`goodpractice` coverage complaints.

## Changed

* Refactored the R binding validation helpers to reuse `validate_common_args()` and `coerce_nullable()` in production code, split `validate_params()` into smaller helper validators, and consolidated duplicated constructor parameter documentation with `@inheritParams` before regenerating the Rd files.
* Updated MSRV to 1.89 to access the significant improvements made in `wide` since version 0.7.
* Abides by new rOpenSci standards.

## Fixed

* Fixed R ASAN tests failing to compile vignettes by passing `--no-build-vignettes` to `rcmdcheck`.
* Upgraded ASAN test environment to use modern `rocker/r-devel-san:latest` image and `RDscript` to resolve outdated `readelf` warnings.
* Fixed `Makefile` idempotency checks on Linux by providing a default `/tmp` fallback for the `TEMP` directory variable.
* Fixed accidental root `Cargo.toml` workspace isolation leaks by adding checked-in `pre-commit` and `pre-push` git hook guards that restore `Cargo.toml.bak` when present and fail loudly if required workspace members are still commented out.
* Added a repo-local `.cargo/config.toml` that sets `CC=clang-cl` for `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, fixing Criterion 0.8 benchmark builds on Windows when `cc-rs` would otherwise pick `clang.exe` and fail to link `alloca`.
* Added strict pre-flight check for Pandoc in `make r` with a clear error message, as it is strictly required for building R Markdown vignettes on all platforms.
* Fixed `make r` failure on Windows when the native `tar.exe` (bsdtar) doesn't support GNU-specific reproducible build flags by adding an automatic fallback.
* Fixed `FIND: Parameter format not correct` error on Windows by replacing `find` commands with cross-platform `rm -f` wildcard expansions to prevent clashing with Windows' native `find.exe`.
* Fixed local compilation error by automatically installing required Python TOML dependencies (`tomli`, `tomli_w`) in the Makefile's R build target.
* Fixed `make r` vignette build crash by adding the missing `BiocStyle` R dependency to the Makefile's automated installation step.
* Replaced the deprecated `devtools::build_vignettes()` command with `pkgdown::build_articles()` for local vignette previewing, and added `pkgdown` to the development dependencies.
* Fixed `cargo test` and `cargo build` failing on Windows due to the default MSVC linker trying to link against `R.lib` by enforcing `--target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` for all R-bound Cargo commands.
* Fixed `R CMD check` `WARNING` on Windows caused by R's own `Boolean.h` using a C23 enum underlying type feature: the previous pragma-based suppression triggered a CRAN `NOTE`. Fixed by pre-defining a standard C `Rboolean` enum and setting the `R_EXT_BOOLEAN_H_` header guard in `entrypoint.c` to prevent R's problematic version from loading.
* Fixed `R CMD check` `ERROR` in the testing phase: `test_check()` always resolves tests from `tests/testthat/` inside the package and ignores custom path arguments. Fixed by updating `dev/prepare_cran.sh` to copy shared tests from `tests/r/testthat/` into `bindings/r/tests/testthat/` before `R CMD build`, and simplifying `testthat.R` to a standard `test_check("rfastlowess")` call.
* Fixed missing R packages (`devtools`, `remotes`) in the Makefile's dependency installation step.
* Fixed `%1 is not a valid Win32 application` and `section below image base` DLL linkage errors on Windows by adding `-Wl,--strip-all` to `Makevars.win` `PKG_LIBS`.
* Fixed rOpenSci `pkgcheck` warning by adding documentation website URL to `DESCRIPTION`.
* Fixed CRAN note regarding non-API call `R_NamespaceRegistry` by upgrading `extendr-api` dependency to `0.9.0`.
* Fixed compilation error by providing the `Result` alias that was removed from `extendr_api::prelude` in `0.9.0`.
* Fixed the remaining SRR/pkgcheck findings in the R package by removing dead internal helper paths, reducing `validate_params()` cyclomatic complexity, eliminating duplicated roxygen parameter blocks, and covering the generated `extendr-wrappers.R` dispatch paths.
