# Streaming Adapter

Process large datasets in chunks with configurable overlap.

## When to Use

- Dataset >100,000 points
- Memory-constrained environments
- Batch processing pipelines

## Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chunk_size` | 5000 | Points per chunk |
| `overlap` | 500 | Overlap between chunks |
| `merge_strategy` | `"weighted_average"` | How to merge overlaps |

### Merge Strategies

| Strategy | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `"average"` | Average overlapping values |
| `"weighted_average"` | Distance-weighted blend |
| `"take_first"` | Keep left chunk values |
| `"take_last"` | Keep right chunk values |

## Example

```@example streaming
using FastLOWESS
using Random, Statistics

rng = MersenneTwister(42)
x = collect(range(0, 2π, length=100))
y = sin.(x) .+ randn(rng, 100) .* 0.3

model = StreamingLowess(;
    fraction=0.3,
    iterations=2,
    chunk_size=5000,
    overlap=500,
    merge_strategy="average"
)
process_chunk(model, x, y)
result = finalize(model)
println("First smoothed value: ", result.y[1])
```

---

!!! warning "Always call finalize()"
    In Rust, always call `processor.finalize()` after processing all chunks to retrieve buffered overlap data.
