# lowess (development version)

## Changed

* Consolidated every crate/binding README: merged the "Installation" and "Documentation" sections, replaced GitHub-only alert syntax with plain blockquotes, removed the redundant "API Reference" and "Changelog" sections (each now has its own docs-site page), shortened the "GPU Backend" blurb, and added a "Read more" link to the Concepts page. The top-level repository README is unchanged, since it's only ever viewed on GitHub.
* Renamed the batch adapter's "When to Use" heading to "When to Use Batch Adapter" across every binding/crate's API docs.
* Vendored the [doxygen-awesome-css](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css) theme (v2.4.2) for a modern, sidebar-only cpp Doxygen site with automatic dark mode.
* Added `dev/update_changelogs.py`, which regenerates a per-binding/crate `NEWS.md`/`news.md` from the root `CHANGELOG.md`. Wired into every docs site's navigation, the Rust crates' rustdoc module tree, and every `Makefile` `dev` target.
* Replaced `kernels.md`'s "Choosing a Kernel" mermaid flowchart (every binding/crate) with an equivalent decision table, since Doxygen and rustdoc don't render mermaid and the deeply-nested diamond chain was hard to read even where it did render.
* Replaced `adapter-choice.md`/`adapters.md`'s "Overview" flowchart (mermaid in most bindings/crates, ASCII art in the C++ docs) with an equivalent decision table, unifying on a single rendering-agnostic format across every binding/crate.
* Moved the duplicated "GPU Acceleration" section (installation, usage, supported features, feature comparison) out of `api.md` in the C++, Node.js, and Python bindings and the `fastLowess` crate into each one's dedicated `gpu-backend.md` guide, which also gained the "Hardware Requirements" and "Performance Considerations" subsections previously only in `api.md`; `api.md` now links to `gpu-backend.md` with a short blurb instead. Removed the same section from the `lowess` crate's `api.md` entirely, since that crate has no `gpu` Cargo feature or GPU backend to document.
* Consolidated `parameters.md`/the auto-generated `@autodocs` parameter reference across every binding and crate (C++, Julia, Node.js, Python, WASM, `fastLowess`, `lowess`): merged its unique content (fraction/iterations choice guidance, `delta`'s per-adapter default, and an inline `zero_weight_fallback` behavior table) into each `api.md`'s builder/options tables (Julia: into the `Lowess`/`StreamingLowess`/`OnlineLowess` docstrings), and removed `parameters.md` itself along with its docs-site navigation entries, `doc::parameters` rustdoc module, and cross-references (now pointing at `api.md`) — the parameter tables, kernel/robustness/boundary/scaling/merge-strategy option lists, and interval/custom-weights code examples it duplicated already live on their own dedicated pages.

## Fixed

* Fixed `docs.yml` triggering GitHub's "pages build and deployment" once per docs job; per-language jobs now upload artifacts, and a single final `deploy` job pushes to `gh-pages` once per run.
* Fixed `docs.yml`'s reliance on GitHub's legacy branch-based Pages deployment, which auto-triggers an unpinned, GitHub-managed "pages build and deployment" job on every `gh-pages` push (surfacing deprecation warnings, e.g. for Node.js 20, that aren't fixable from this repo). The former `deploy` job is now `build`, which still pushes the merged `_site` to `gh-pages` as a cache for future incremental runs, but publishing now goes through `actions/upload-pages-artifact` and a new `deploy` job using the official `actions/deploy-pages`, which this repo pins directly. Requires the repository's Pages source to be switched to "GitHub Actions" in settings.
* Fixed the "Handling Outliers" quickstart example (every binding and the `lowess`/`fastLowess` crates) printing nothing: with only 6 points and `fraction = 0.5`, the local window is small enough that tricube weighting drives the farthest neighbor's weight to ~0, leaving just 2 effectively-weighted points, which a degree-1 fit reproduces exactly (zero residual, no downweighting) — confirmed directly against the `lowess`/`loess` core, not binding-specific. Bumped to `fraction = 0.7`, which correctly downweights the injected outlier.
* Fixed the R `OnlineLowess()` roxygen example printing one line per point (48 lines for a 50-point loop); it now collects the smoothed values and prints only `head(smoothed, 5)`.
* Fixed the R `add_point()` roxygen example always printing `NULL`, since a single call never reaches the default `min_points = 3`; it now uses `min_points = 2L` and shows the second (non-`NULL`) call's result.
* Fixed the R `robustness.Rmd` "Detecting Outliers" example printing 22 lines at the `weight < 0.5` threshold, most of them incidental noise rather than the 3 deliberately injected outliers; tightened to `weight < 0.05`, which isolates the points effectively excluded by the fit.
* Fixed the R `merge.Rmd` "Choosing Chunk Size and Overlap" example constructing a `StreamingLowess` model but never printing anything; it now prints the computed overlap size and its percentage of `chunk_size`.
* Fixed the R `use-case-genomics.Rmd` ChIP-seq example never calling `fit()`, so `result` referenced a stale variable from an earlier chunk and the smoothed line either failed to plot or didn't align with the current example's x-range; added the missing `result <- fit(model, positions, signal_noisy)` call.
* Fixed the R `use-case-real-time.Rmd` "Update Modes" example constructing a `"full"`-mode `OnlineLowess` model but never feeding it data or plotting a result; it now runs the same accumulate-and-plot pattern as the preceding example.
* Fixed the "Detecting Outliers" example's `robustness.md` page (C++, Node.js, WASM, and the `lowess`/`fastLowess` crates) printing an unbounded number of "is likely an outlier" lines; capped output at 5 lines, matching the already-capped Julia and Python versions and the R vignette fix above.
* Fixed the Julia `intervals.md` "Confidence Intervals" and "Standard Errors" examples each looping over all 100 points instead of a short sample; switched to `result.y[1:5]`/`result.confidence_lower[1:5]`/`result.standard_errors[1:5]`-style slicing, matching the already-concise Python version.
* Fixed inline/display LaTeX math rendering as literal text on docs.rs; added a `katex-header.html` that renders it client-side with KaTeX.
* Fixed every cross-reference link across the `lowess`/`fastLowess` crate docs (`quickstart.md`, `api.md`, `concepts.md`, and others) leading nowhere: these pages are embedded into rustdoc via `#![doc = include_str!(...)]`, and plain relative links like `[Concepts](concepts.md)` are rendered verbatim rather than resolved against the generated module tree. Converted every such link to a proper intra-doc link (e.g. `[Concepts](crate::doc::concepts)`), validated with `cargo doc --all-features` under `-D warnings` (zero broken-link warnings).

# lowess 3.1.0

## Added

* Added a GitHub Pages landing page at the repository root, built from `README.md` via pandoc and deployed by `docs.yml`.
* Added a GitHub workflow for running validation scripts.

## Changed

* Split the monolithic `.github/workflows/ci.yml` into seven per-language workflow files: `ci-rust.yml`, `ci-python.yml`, `ci-julia.yml`, `ci-nodejs.yml`, `ci-wasm.yml`, `ci-cpp.yml`, and `ci-r.yml`. Each file carries the relevant `ci` (multi-OS matrix), `asan`, and `gpu` jobs for its language.
* Each crate/binding sub-Makefile now runs `dev/verify_snippets.py --lang <lang>` for its own language as the final step of `make default`. The root `docs-test` target remains as a convenience to run all languages at once.
* Split `dev/verify_snippets.py` into a lean orchestrator and a `dev/runners/` package. Each language has its own module (`python.py`, `julia.py`, `nodejs.py`, `r.py`, `wasm.py`, `rust.py`, `cpp.py`) containing its `run_<lang>()` function and a `skip_reason()` predicate. Shared types (`Snippet`, `RunResult`) and utilities live in `runners/base.py`; the registry (`RUNNERS`, `SKIP_CHECKS`) is exported from `runners/__init__.py`.
* Moved CHANGELOG and CONTRIBUTING guides to project root.
* Updated README files to be binding/crate specific instead of one generic README for all bindings/crates.
* Moved crate documentation from ReadTheDocs to <https://docs.rs/lowess>.
* `make lowess` (`default:`) now only runs `cargo build`. The full dev workflow moves to `make lowess-dev`.

## Fixed

* Fixed `.cargo/config.toml` hardcoding absolute `c:/rtools45/...` paths for the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` linker and ar tool. Replaced with bare tool names resolved via `PATH`, matching the existing fix in `bindings/r/src/cargo-config.toml`.

# lowess 3.0.0

## Changed

* Removed `dev/isolate_cargo.py`, `dev/check_root_cargo.py`, `dev/fix_doc_snippets.py`, and `check_js_licenses.js` — workspace isolation, doc-snippet transformation, and license checks are no longer needed.
* Split the monolithic root `Makefile` into per-crate/binding sub-Makefiles (e.g. `crates/lowess/Makefile`, `bindings/r/Makefile`), each invokable directly via `make -f path/Makefile`. The root `Makefile` now only aggregates (`docs`, `check-msrv`, `all*`).
* Moved Rust and binding tests into their respective crate/binding directories (e.g. `tests/lowess/` → `crates/lowess/tests/lowess/`, `tests/cpp/` → `bindings/cpp/tests/`). Removed the standalone `tests/` workspace packages and `bindings/r/demo/`.
* Renamed `OnlineOutput`'s `smoothed` and `std_error` fields to `y` and `standard_error`, matching `LowessResult`. This is a **breaking change**.
* Updated `wide` to v1.6.

# lowess 2.0.0

## Added

* Added `iterations_used: Option<usize>` field to `OnlineOutput<T>`, reporting the number of robustness iterations performed when `UpdateMode::Full` is active. Returns `Some(0)` for the degenerate two-point linear fit and `None` when `UpdateMode::Incremental` is used.
* Added `ParseErrors(Vec<LowessError>)` variant to `LowessError`, which collects all string-parse failures that accumulate in the builder and reports them together when `build()` is called.
* Added `"take_first"` and `"take_last"` as accepted string aliases for `MergeStrategy::TakeFirst` and `MergeStrategy::TakeLast`.
* Added `"resmooth"` as an accepted string alias for `UpdateMode::Full` and `"single"` as an alias for `UpdateMode::Incremental`, aligning string-parse behaviour with the `loess-rs` crate.
* Added `custom_weights(Vec<T>)` builder method on `LowessBuilder` (Batch adapter only). Accepts a vector of non-negative per-observation weights that are multiplied into the distance and robustness weights before each local regression, allowing known-bad points to be suppressed (`0.0`) or high-quality measurements to be emphasised.
* Centralized all `impl FromStr` blocks for the seven option enums (`WeightFunction`, `BoundaryPolicy`, `ScalingMethod`, `RobustnessMethod`, `ZeroWeightFallback`, `MergeStrategy`, `UpdateMode`) directly in `api.rs`, consolidating previously scattered implementations into a single source of truth. Parse and canonical-name helpers are exposed via `lowess::internals::alias` (requires `dev` feature), allowing `fastLowess::binding_support` to delegate all string-to-enum parsing through that path.
* Added module-level `defaults.rs` files within each sub-module (`math/`, `algorithms/`, `adapters/`) to centralize default values close to the types they govern, propagating them from a single source of truth to ensure consistency across bindings and crates.

## Changed

* Renamed all public API method and option names from camelCase to snake_case across every binding and all documentation. This is a **breaking change** for all consumers of the C++, Node.js, and WASM APIs.
* Converted all documentation tables to compact single-space format.
* Updated `.clang-tidy` to configure `lower_case` as the required naming convention for functions and member functions, matching the new snake_case public API.
* Moved `BENCHMARKS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` from the repository root into `docs/` and added them to the documentation site navigation.
* Added a `[patch.crates-io]` section to the root `Cargo.toml` so all workspace bindings resolve `fastLowess` and `lowess` to the local workspace crates during development, replacing the previously-used registry (crates.io) versions.
* Eliminated all local `parse_*` functions that each binding previously duplicated independently. Option parsing and builder application now delegates to `fastLowess::binding_support`, ensuring consistent aliases, validation messages, and behaviour across every language frontend.
* Replaced direct use of `KFold` / `LOOCV` constructor types in the cross-validation path with `binding_support::apply_cross_validation`.
* Split the Julia release CI workflow into two separate workflows: `release-julia-jll.yml` (triggered on release, opens the Yggdrasil PR) and `release-julia-register.yml` (manual dispatch, triggers JuliaRegistrator once the JLL PR is merged).
* Major documentation improvements.
* Added `Lowess<T>`, `StreamingLowess<T>`, and `OnlineLowess<T>` type aliases as the primary user-facing constructors (e.g. `StreamingLowess::new().chunk_size(50).build()`). Mode-specific builder methods (`chunk_size`, `overlap`, `window_capacity`, `min_points`, `update_mode`) are now called directly on the type alias rather than after `.adapter()`.
* Made `BatchLowessBuilder`, `StreamingLowessBuilder`, and `OnlineLowessBuilder` internal-only: all public setter methods have been removed from these types. All smoothing configuration now flows through `LowessBuilder<T, Mode>` (exposed via the type aliases above). This is a **breaking change** for any code that called setter methods on an adapter builder directly.
* Changed all enum-typed builder methods to accept strings instead: `weight_function`, `robustness_method`, `scaling_method`, `boundary_policy`, `zero_weight_fallback`, `merge_strategy`, and `update_mode` now take `impl IntoEnum<T>` (accepting both enum variants and strings such as `.weight_function("tricube")`) rather than requiring enum variants to be imported. This is a **breaking change** for any code passing enum variants directly.
* Inlined the `IntoEnum<E>` trait and its macro-generated impls for all enum-typed builder parameters directly into `api.rs` (`lowess`) and `binding_support.rs` (`fastLowess`), eliminating a previously separate `parse` module. This allows builder methods to accept either a typed enum value (e.g. `.weight_function(WeightFunction::Tricube)`) or a string (e.g. `.weight_function("tricube")`) interchangeably.
* Replaced the `cross_validate(CVConfig)` builder method (which required importing `KFold` or `LOOCV` types) with a string-based cross-validation API: `.cv_method("kfold")` / `.cv_method("loocv")`, `.cv_k(n)`, `.cv_fractions(vec![...])`, and `.cv_seed(n)`. `KFold` and `LOOCV` are no longer exported from the prelude. This is a **breaking change** for any code using the old `cross_validate` API.
* Added a `binding_support` module providing shared helpers for all language binding frontends: string-to-enum parse functions (`parse_weight_function`, `parse_robustness_method`, `parse_scaling_method`, `parse_boundary_policy`, `parse_zero_weight_fallback`, `parse_merge_strategy`, `parse_update_mode`), matching canonical-string display functions, `BuilderOptionSet` / `TypedBuilderOptionSet` structs, and `apply_builder_options` / `apply_typed_builder_options` / `apply_cross_validation` helpers. This consolidates previously duplicated logic that was scattered across every binding into a single source of truth.
* Renamed the internal `auto_convergence` struct field to `auto_converge` on `BatchLowessBuilder`, `OnlineLowessBuilder`, `StreamingLowessBuilder`, and the executor config types, making the field name consistent with the existing `auto_converge()` setter method. This is a **breaking change** for any code that accessed these fields directly.
* Changed `build()` to wrap all accumulated string-parse errors in a `LowessError::ParseErrors(Vec<LowessError>)` value instead of surfacing only the first error. This is a **breaking change** for code that matched on `LowessError::InvalidOption` as the error returned from `build()`.
* Made the `IntoEnum<E>` trait `pub(crate)` in both `lowess` and `fastLowess`, restricting it to crate-internal use. Callers do not need to name this trait; builder methods continue to accept both enum variants and string literals unchanged.
* Updated `wide` dependency to v1.5, `wgpu` to v30.0, and `pollster` to v1.0.

# lowess 1.3.0

## Added

* Added prerequisites for different bindings and platforms to `CONTRIBUTING.md`
* Updated `docs/assets/diagrams/lowess_smoothing_concept.svg` to correctly illustrate LOWESS concepts (robustness iterations, bisquare re-weighting, outlier downweighting) instead of the generic LOESS algorithm it previously depicted.

## Fixed

* Fixed R ASAN tests failing to compile vignettes by passing `--no-build-vignettes` to `rcmdcheck`.
* Upgraded ASAN test environment to use modern `rocker/r-devel-san:latest` image and `RDscript` to resolve outdated `readelf` warnings.
* Fixed `Makefile` idempotency checks on Linux by providing a default `/tmp` fallback for the `TEMP` directory variable.
* Fixed accidental root `Cargo.toml` workspace isolation leaks by adding checked-in `pre-commit` and `pre-push` git hook guards that restore `Cargo.toml.bak` when present and fail loudly if required workspace members are still commented out.
* Added a repo-local `.cargo/config.toml` that sets `CC=clang-cl` for `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, fixing Criterion 0.8 benchmark builds on Windows when `cc-rs` would otherwise pick `clang.exe` and fail to link `alloca`.
